# nextjs-practice  
This repository holds a number of different Next.js practice projects and builds.

**Projects/Work:**

1. **Medium Build** - This is a mockup/clone of a Medium front page (https://medium.com/) which I worked on while following a tutorial by Sonny Sangha. This is a one page build that utilizes React, Next.js, some elements of TypeScript, and the Tailwind CSS 3.0 framework. Although the tutorial accessed and updated page data with Sanity CMS (content management system) (https://www.sanity.io/), I opted to use a test array with some hardcoded data instead due to some technical issues working with Sanity on my VS Code. That being said, this was a great excercise in working with Next.js and an ideal first project to get acquainted with the framework.

2. **Facebook Clone** - I built this clone, while following Sonny Sangha's tutorial (see link to his channel in #1 above), using a combination of React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS 3.0. The tutorial included backend steps, such as the use of NextAuth.js for user authentication, although I decided to focus primarily on the UI aspect of the build. My main goal for this project was to get comfortable with Tailwind CSS and really dive into the responsive design elements that the framework provides.  

3. **Instagram Clone** - I worked on this build alongside Sonny's tutorial (link to his channel in #1 above). The main goal for this project was to continue getting comfortable with building applications using Next.js and to learn additional libraries and tools that would enhance my understanding of web development. Although I followed the tutorial closely I did make some adjustments that made the build slightly different. For this project I used Next.js, React, some Firebase v9 functionality, NextAuth.js, Faker.js, Tailwind CSS 3.0 (including a new to me plugin - Tailwind Scrollbar), and the built in Next.js router. I also got some exposure and practice with Recoil JS. This project also had a heavy focus on responsive design and using various design elements to improve the UI/UX, which I found to be an enjoyable process.

4. **WhatsApp Build** - An attempt to build a WhatsApp clone. I had some issues with using Firebase with this build and as such this project is currently ongoing (still need to connect to the database for it to work). That being said the project uses Styled Components and gave me some experience with a new way of styling. I also got some practice with using the Material UI library for additional component functionality, React Firebase hooks, email validation methods, and NextJS built in routing.
