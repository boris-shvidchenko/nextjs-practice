# nextjs-practice  
This repository holds a number of different Next.js practice projects and builds.

**Projects/Work:**

1. **Medium Build** - This is a mockup/clone of a Medium front page (https://medium.com/) which I worked on while following a tutorial by Sonny Sangha. This is a one page build that utilizes React, Next.js, some elements of TypeScript, and the Tailwind CSS 3.0 framework. Although the tutorial accessed and updated page data with Sanity CMS (content management system) (https://www.sanity.io/), I opted to use a test array with some hardcoded data instead due to some technical issues working with Sanity on my VS Code. That being said, this was a great excercise in working with Next.js and an ideal first project to get acquainted with the framework.
